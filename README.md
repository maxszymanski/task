# Recruitment task

An application built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
I used React Query to fetch and cache data.

The search works when you press Enter, which allows you to limit the number of queries to the API and simplify the logic.

I added simple loading and error handling, and ensured the responsiveness and basic accessibility of the interface.
